# Team SBC

An effort to create an opinionated open source hardware, software, and documentation ecosystem targeting and supporting affordable single board computers.

## Remix

TeamSBC provides a Fedora Remix. This is a Linux distribution built with [Fedora Linux](https://fedoraproject.org) packages. Additionally we install our [own packages](https://github.com/teamsbc/packages). We build [ready to use artifacts](https://github.com/teamsbc/artifacts) that you can run on supported hardware.
